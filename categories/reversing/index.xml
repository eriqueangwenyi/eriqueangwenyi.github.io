      <description>REVERSE ENGINEERING:UPX PACKED EXECUTABLE Attached is a binary called good luck. You are expected to reverse engineer it and capture the flag. Alternatively, the binary can be found at https://www.dropbox.com/s/mq70390yokr2l02/goodluck?dl=0

There is not much information from that except for the fact that it is a 64bit executable.
